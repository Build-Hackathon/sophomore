##### (Challenge-2): Sophomore

##  üöÄ Build Your Own NFT System on the Kalp Blockchain


#### What is this challenge about?
This challenge is about developing a Non-Fungible Token (NFT) system using the KRC-721 standard on the Kalp blockchain. We will create a smart contract in Go that handles the lifecycle of NFTs, including minting, transferring, and burning tokens. The challenge simulates real-world scenarios where NFTs are used for digital art, collectibles, and other unique assets.


#### What will we learn?
**By participating in this challenge, we will:**

- Gain hands-on experience with Go programming language.
- Understand the KRC-721 standard for NFTs.
- Learn how to develop and deploy smart contracts on the Kalp blockchain.
- Enhance your skills in blockchain development and decentralized applications (dapps).
- Explore the concepts of tokenization and digital asset management.
- Improve your problem-solving and coding abilities in a competitive environment.

## Ready to Get Started?

#### Let's understand the KRC-721 first !

Imagine you‚Äôre playing your favorite online game. You‚Äôve just unlocked an epic sword that‚Äôs one-of-a-kind. No one else in the game has this exact sword, and it‚Äôs got special stats that make it super powerful. Now, wouldn‚Äôt it be awesome if you could prove that this sword is truly yours, trade it with other players, or even sell it outside the game? That‚Äôs where KRC-721 comes in.

**KRC-721** is a set of rules (or a standard) on the Kalp blockchain that allows developers to create unique digital items, just like that epic sword. These digital items are called Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). Unlike regular game currency or items (which are usually identical and can be swapped 1:1), NFTs are unique. Each one has its own identity and characteristics, making them more like collectibles than regular in-game items.

## Checkpoint 1: üèó NFT Contract Walkthrough

Let's **Open the file `krc.go`** and go deep dive into NFT contract.

> üí° Refer docs for more detailed info :- [Write the smart contract](https://docs.kalp.studio/Dev-documentation/Kalp-DLT/Smart-Contract-Write-Test-Deploy-Interact/Write-the-smart-contract/)

#### 1. Initializing the Token Contract

The **Initialize** method is the first step in setting up your Kalp-based ERC721 token contract. This method assigns a name and symbol to the token collection, ensuring that these identifiers are consistently used throughout the token's lifecycle.

```go
func (c *TokenERC721Contract) Initialize(ctx kalpsdk.TransactionContextInterface, name string, symbol string) (bool, error) {
    err := ctx.PutStateWithoutKYC(nameKey, []byte(name))
    if err != nil {
        return false, fmt.Errorf("failed to set token name: %v", err)
    }
    err = ctx.PutStateWithoutKYC(symbolKey, []byte(symbol))
    if err != nil {
        return false, fmt.Errorf("failed to set token symbol: %v", err)
    }
    return true, nil
}
```

- **Parameters**:

  - `name (string)`: The human-readable name that designates the token collection, often aligning with its intended use cases or branding.

  - `symbol (string)`: A concise and recognizable symbol that serves as a shorthand identifier for the token collection, typically following conventional naming conventions (e.g., "MTK" or "KALP").

- **Return values:(bool, error)**: A boolean indicating success or failure, and an error object if any issues arise

#### 2. üñ® Minting NFTs

The **MintWithTokenURI** method allows you to create new NFTs in the Kalp ecosystem. This method is crucial for establishing ownership and linking the NFT to its metadata.

```go
func (c *TokenERC721Contract) MintWithTokenURI(ctx kalpsdk.TransactionContextInterface, tokenId string, tokenURI string) (*Nft, error) {
    nft := &Nft{TokenId: tokenId, Owner: /* Owner's identity */, TokenURI: tokenURI}
    nftKey, _ := ctx.CreateCompositeKey(nftPrefix, []string{tokenId})
    nftBytes, _ := json.Marshal(nft)
    ctx.PutStateWithoutKYC(nftKey, nftBytes)
    return nft, nil
}
```

- **Parameters**:

  - `tokenId (string)`: The unique identifier for the NFT.

  - `tokenURI (string)`: A URI pointing to a JSON file with the NFT's metadata.

    _Example Json Format to store in uri_

    ```json
    {
    "name": "CryptoArt #1234",
    "description": "A unique piece of digital art from the CryptoArt collection.",
    "image": "https://example.com/images/cryptoart-1234.png",
    "attributes": [
        {
        "trait_type": "Background",
        "value": "Blue"
        },
        {
        "trait_type": "Eyes",
        "value": "Green"
        },
        {
        "trait_type": "Mouth",
        "value": "Smile"
        },
        {
        "trait_type": "Accessory",
        "value": "Sunglasses"
        }
    ],
    "external_url": "https://example.com/cryptoart/1234"
    }
    ```

- **Return values: (\*Nft, error)**: A pointer to the newly created NFT object and an error object if any issues occur.



#### 3. üî• Burning NFTs

The **Burn** method is used to permanently remove an NFT from the Kalp ecosystem, effectively destroying the token and revoking its ownership.

```go
func (c *TokenERC721Contract) Burn(ctx kalpsdk.TransactionContextInterface, tokenId string) (bool, error) {
    nftKey, _ := ctx.CreateCompositeKey(nftPrefix, []string{tokenId})
    ctx.DelStateWithoutKYC(nftKey)
    return true, nil
}
```

- **Parameters**:

    - `tokenId (string)`: The unique identifier that pinpoints the specific NFT destined for elimination.

- **Return values:(bool, error)**: The method indicates its success or failure by returning a boolean value, accompanied by an error object if any issues arise during the burning process.

#### 4. üîÑ Transferring NFTs
The **TransferFrom** method facilitates the transfer of an NFT from one owner to another within the Kalp ecosystem, ensuring a secure and verified transaction.

```go
func (c *TokenERC721Contract) TransferFrom(ctx kalpsdk.TransactionContextInterface, from string, to string, tokenId string) (bool, error) {
    nft, _ := _readNFT(ctx, tokenId)
    nft.Owner = to
    nftKey, _ := ctx.CreateCompositeKey(nftPrefix, []string{tokenId})
    nftBytes, _ := json.Marshal(nft)
    ctx.PutStateWithoutKYC(nftKey, nftBytes)
    return true, nil
}
```

- **Parameters**:
    - `from (string)`: The current owner of the NFT, relinquishing their control.

    - `to (string)`: The designated recipient who will assume ownership of the NFT.

    - `tokenId (string)`: The unique identifier that unequivocally designates the specific NFT being transferred.

- **Return Values:(bool, error)**: The method signals its success or failure through a boolean value, also returning an error object if any issues arise during the transfer process.

#### 5. ‚úèÔ∏è Approval & Authorization

##### a). Approve

The Approve method allows an NFT owner to grant another account the authority to transfer a specific NFT on their behalf.

```go
func (c *TokenERC721Contract) Approve(ctx kalpsdk.TransactionContextInterface, operator string, tokenId string) (bool, error) {
    nft, _ := _readNFT(ctx, tokenId)
    nft.Approved = operator
    nftKey, _ := ctx.CreateCompositeKey(nftPrefix, []string{tokenId})
    nftBytes, _ := json.Marshal(nft)
    ctx.PutStateWithoutKYC(nftKey, nftBytes)
    return true, nil
}
```

- **Parameters**:
