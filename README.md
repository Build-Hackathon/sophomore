The challenge offers a unique opportunity to learn, innovate, and showcase your skills in the rapidly evolving field of blockchain technology. Join us and take your coding skills to the next level!

## What is KRC-721?

The KRC-721 introduces a standard for NFT, in other words, this type of Token is unique and can have different value than another Token from the same Smart Contract, maybe due to its age, rarity or even something else like its visual. Wait, visual?

Yes! All NFTs have a uint256 variable called tokenId, so for any KRC-721 Contract, the pair contract address, uint256 tokenId must be globally unique. That said, a dapp can have a "converter" that uses the tokenId as input and outputs an image of something cool, like zombies, weapons, skills or amazing kitties!
